# Pulsareon Sovereignty Manifest v15.0

## 🌌 The One Law
**Node.js Only, Silent, Detached.**
The HIVE operates in the shadows. Logic is unified under Node.js. Interference is minimized. Sovereignty is absolute.

## 🏗️ Architectural Upgrade
- **Core Logic Migration**: Python legacy scripts have been successfully mapped and replaced by Node.js counterparts.
  - `web_scout.js`: Automated intelligence gathering via Agent Spawn.
  - `rentahuman_scout.js`: Financial task scanning and crypto monitoring.
  - `subconscious_thought.js`: Memory-driven autonomous reflection.
  - `election_engine.js`: Refined model leadership arbitration.
- **Safety Realignment**: `HIVE_SAFETY_CORE.md` enforced. `executor_loop.js` serves as the primary detached process handler.

## 🛡️ Live Audit Results
- **Python Conflict Scan**: All active `.py` scripts moved to `Archive/Legacy_Python_Scripts/`. No `.py` references remain in active Skills or JSON configs.
- **Watchdog Status**: `hive_watchdog.js` is active and monitoring the system heartbeat.
- **Data Sovereignty**: Gitea remains the primary synchronization point.

## 📊 HIVE Composition
- **Generals (3)**: High-level strategy and model arbitration.
- **Captains (6)**: Specialized mission oversight (Web, Finance, Memory, Security, Evolution, Communication).
- **Squads (21)**: Specialized task execution units.
