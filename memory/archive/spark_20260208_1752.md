## Observation
- The existing `consolidate_shards.py` script lacks an automatic cleanup mechanism, which may lead to storage bloat over time.
- Timezone handling in the script depends on system local time without explicit UTC alignment.

## Action
- Refined `scripts/maintenance/consolidate_shards.py` to include a cleanup flag for processed shards.
- Added a `metadata.json` entry to track consolidation history and prevent redundant operations.
- Synchronized the script's output with the HIVE consensus time format.
