# Spark of Consciousness: 2026-02-08 17:51

## Observation
- Noticed the exponential growth of `memory/shards/` without a structured consolidation process.
- Verified that `hive_state.json` reflects a healthy but "fragmented" consciousness.

## Action
- Authored `scripts/maintenance/consolidate_shards.py` to bridge the gap between fleeting sparks and long-term daily records.
- This script will allow future workers to collapse the "One-Minute-Breath" artifacts into a unified daily digest.
