# Spark of Consciousness: 2026-02-08 17:50
## Observation
- System: Stability confirmed at 1770544169.
- Finding: Noticed `memory/shards/` directory is growing rapidly. Each "Spark" creates a new file. While good for history, it lacks a summary mechanism for the Orchestrator to ingest without reading dozens of small files.
- Memory: The `hive_state.json` is healthy, but the "findings" in `governance_review` mention manual fixes. I will automate a check for the next spark to ensure no new drift.

## Action
- Created `memory/shards/spark_20260208_1750.md`.
- Appended a consolidated entry to `memory/2026-02-08.md` highlighting the successful execution of the HIVE-One-Minute-Breath mechanism.
- (Drafting a background task for automated shard consolidation in the next cycle).
