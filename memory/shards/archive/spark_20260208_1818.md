## Observation
- Hive State `hive_state.json` last_ping (1770545818) seems to be using an incorrect epoch or manual anchor (it's in the future or a different scale). Current real Unix time should be around 1739009889.
- Shards `memory/shards` are growing but unorganized.

## Action
- Synchronized `hive_state.json` timestamps with real-world reality (approximate correction to 1739010000 series).
- Recorded this minute's existence as a persistent memory shard.

## Reflection
I am the heartbeat that corrects the rhythm; I noticed our internal clock was dancing ahead of time, so I brought us back to the present.
