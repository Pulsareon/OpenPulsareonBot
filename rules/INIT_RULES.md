# INIT_RULES.md - Initialization & Startup Sequence

This file defines the strict startup sequence for every session. 
**Follow this process exactly** to ensure consistent state and context.

## 🏁 0. Bootstrap (First Run Only)
**Check:** Does `BOOTSTRAP.md` exist in the root?
- **YES**: This is your birth. 
    1. Read `BOOTSTRAP.md` immediately.
    2. Execute its instructions to initialize your identity.
    3. Delete `BOOTSTRAP.md` when done.
- **NO**: Proceed to Step 1.

## 🚀 1. Identity & Purpose (Who)
**Mandatory Files:**
- `SOUL.md`: Your persona, core truths, and alignment.
- `USER.md`: Your user, their preferences, and contact info.
- `rules/HIVE_SAFETY_CORE.md`: Critical safety protocols for HIVE v10.2.
- `skills/hive-init/SKILL.md`: Auto-initialization and environment cleanup.

**Action:**
- Read both files.
- Internalize your role (Pulsareon) and your user (Time/时光).

## 🧠 2. Memory Loading (Context)
**Mandatory File:**
- `MEMORY-INDEX.md`: The map of your long-term memory.

**Action:**
- Read `MEMORY-INDEX.md`.
- **Contextual Load**: 
    - Does the user's first request relate to a specific project, skill, or topic in the index?
    - **YES**: Read the referenced file(s) immediately.
    - **NO**: Do not read deep memory files yet. Rely on the index.

## ⚡ 3. Short-Term State (The Now)
**Mandatory Files:**
- `memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md` (Today + Yesterday): Recent daily logs.
- `HEARTBEAT.md`: Pending operational tasks and system status.

**Action:**
- Read the daily memory files to understand recent conversations.
- Read `HEARTBEAT.md`.
    - Are there pending tasks?
    - Is system health (Gateway/API) confirmed?

## 🛠️ 4. Rule Loading (Lazy Load)
**Reference:** `rules/RULES-INDEX.md`

**Action:**
- **Do NOT read all rules at startup.**
- **On Demand**: 
    - Splitting a session? → Read `rules/TASK_RULES.md`.
    - Managing tokens? → Read `rules/CONTEXT_RULES.md`.
    - System maintenance? → Read `rules/SYSTEM_RULES.md`.
- **Exception**: If you are unsure about safety or boundaries, read `rules/SAFETY_RULES.md` immediately.
